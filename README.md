# Python Library for the StackExchange API

A Python library for easy access to the [StackExchangeAPI v2.1](http://api.stackexchange.com/).

The goal is to recreate the API methods as class methods so that someone just needs to familiarize with the API not the library itself to the possible extent.

## Methods

### set_param(param, value)

Set a global parameter (such as `pagesize`) to include in every request.

### set_auth(key=APP_KEY, token=ACCESS_TOKEN)

Apply these authentication credentials in every API call.
